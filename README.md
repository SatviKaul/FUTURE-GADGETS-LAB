### The idea: Easy and Efficient access to Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS)
As we see there's no time in getting introduced by a bunch of Electric Vehicles (EV) around us. 
Since the new launch would create opportunity for many companies to set up their charging stations around the state. 
But in the very beginning the customer (or the owner of the car) may take come across a situation when he needs to charge his EV.
He goes to the nearest EVCS (Electric Vehicle Charging Station) and found a queue.

#### Problem: Unlike refueling a fuel powered vehicle recharging an EV takes time, mostly in hours.
A customer always wants the shortest possible queue and least waiting time. This is where our idea comes into role.
