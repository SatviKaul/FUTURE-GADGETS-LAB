## Idea  :bulb: : Easy and Efficient access to Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS)
As we see there's no time in getting introduced by a bunch of Electric Vehicles (EV) around us. 
Since the new launch would create opportunity for many companies to set up their charging stations around the state. 
The customer (or the owner of the car) may come across a situation when he needs to charge his EV. He goes to the nearest EVCS (Electric Vehicle Charging Station) and found a queue and he has to wait in the queue.

<br>

### Problem: Unlike refueling a fuel powered vehicle recharging an EV takes time, mostly in hours.
Refueling a vehicle takes hardly a minute but in an electric vehicle, it takes time in hours.
A customer always wants the shortest possible queue and least waiting time. This is where our idea comes into role.
This app will help you locate the nearest EVCS and shows the approximate waiting time in realtime. It is very much reliable. Based on locatiion and waiting time as parameters, it can help you locate the most appropriate EVCS.
